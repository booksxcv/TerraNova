## Generic
To take photos, you need a camera and glass film. Every camera must have a body and a lens to function, but you can also equip your camera with other components to change the way it functions. Glass film is what you use to stamp a photo on. Two types of glass film exist, one for the standard black and white photos and one for color photos. It takes two hands to use a camera. As per the rules of skill checks, it takes one action to take a photo and another action to to remove and insert new glass film. Each camera lens has a short and a long range. To take photos beyond the short range imposes disadvantage on the skill check. 

## DC
To take a photo that depicts what you want it to you need to succeed on a skill check using your Camera Kit adding your Wisdom modifier or any other modifier, to the DM's discretion. The camera operates like a kit and the DM set the DC based on the difficulty of photographing the desired motif, lighting and anything else that the current situation dictates. The DM might ignore the need to roll as they see fit. Failure on this check still yields a photo, but it does not fully capture the intended motif, to the DM's discretion. The glass film is spent regardless. 

## Body & Components
The body of the camera is the base. To use a body, you need a lens which takes up a component slot. Each type has stats, including weight, price, number of component slots and their unique qualities.

Boxy contraption with a lens on one side, and a viewfinder and shutter mechanism on the other. Takes 10 pictures with a single roll of film, which must be developed in order to view the pictures. Ability checks are needed to take good pictures â€“ Intelligence-based rolls to get pictures which capture important information, Wisdom-based rolls to take aesthetically pleasing photographs. Development requires a darkroom equipped with the proper chemicals, costing 1 gp per roll as a professional service in town, or 1 sp per roll for the chemicals if you have your own darkroom. Replacement film is 1 gp per roll. Proficiency in the camera includes skill with darkrooms and development.
