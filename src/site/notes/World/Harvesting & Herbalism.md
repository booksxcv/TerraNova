# Forewords

This harvesting system is made in the spirit of simplicity and to add a shallow layer of herbalism to the current ruleset. This includes locating, harvesting, using plants as a random encounter.

The DM can use these rules as a streamlined way of harvesting plants, but they can also use the Locating Plants section as a random encounter when there is a logical reason to stumble upon plants. The DM should consider what player characters know about plants before it is used as a random encounter. A party that lacks knowledge may miss an opportunity to gather a valuable plant.

There are four tiers of plants - [[World/Harvesting & Herbalism#Common Plants Table\|Common]], [[World/Harvesting & Herbalism#Uncommon Plants Table\|Uncommon]], [[World/Harvesting & Herbalism#Rare Plants Table\|Rare]] and [[World/Harvesting & Herbalism#Unique Plants\|Unique]]. 

- Common plants function as a fill category - they can be used to control prices of products that you can create with plants. They are all one single category "Common plants" and are measured in gold worth of common plants.
- Uncommon plants are separated by their property, and are meant to add flavor to a given product that you can create using plants. They are categorised by their property, separately from other properties and measured in silver worth (for example, 10 sp worth of Medicinal plants). The property defines the plant as an Uncommon plant.
	- The properties are: [[World/Harvesting & Herbalism#^62f40f\|Invigorating]], [[World/Harvesting & Herbalism#^5947b4\|Medicinal]], [[World/Harvesting & Herbalism#^e8a648\|Mystical]], [[World/Harvesting & Herbalism#^a8ce26\|Noxious]] and [[World/Harvesting & Herbalism#^a7ac52\|Soothing]].
- Rare plants are hard to find and/or harvest and are meant to be used to further add flavor to a given product that you can create using plants. They are categorised by their property and their rarity. They are measured in silver worth (for example, 20 sp worth of Rare Medicinal plants), but may of course be changed as the DM see fit. Additionally, rare plants are all also able to be used in an unrefined state, with a minor effect that comes at a cost of a specific amount. The DM may use these rarity of plants to make a product of herbalism be harder to craft, using a rare plant as a gatekeeper for the product.
- Unique plants go beyond the scope of this harvesting system, but a few examples are included here. They are meant to allow the DM to create epic stories and/or quests to find plants of unique power. They are unique because they all require specific requirements to be met for them to grow, which may transcend biome and/or property. A few examples of unique plants described below.

# Step 0: Knowledge

To Locate plants a character must have knowledge of what they are looking for, which are included in a number of skills listed in the table below. If the character have information at hand about a specific type of plants they may locate plants that is included in said information. Once you have determined what knowledge is available to the characters, they learn if it is possible to find what they are searching for within the region. 

> [!tip|c-blue] A character with knowledge in Herbalism Kit or Nature knows about all Uncommon plants too.

A person with ==expertise== in any of the above skills might know about higher tiers of plants. At the DM's discretion, this might be an automatic success or include a successful roll using their skill and Intelligence as a modifier.Â The DC is set at the DM's discretion. 

Also, determine what biome the characters are searching in and whether it is ==summer or winter==, which will determine the DC to locate plants of a given rarity as well as what plants can be found during that season. 

Once you have established these three things(character knowledge, biome where searching and season, move to [[World/Harvesting & Herbalism#Step 1 Locate plants\|locate plants]] presented below. 

## Properties

**Invigorating.** Plants with the Invigorating property can be used in recipes that temporarily boost a creatures capabilities or fortifying the mind or body.

# Step 1: Locate plants

The player declares where their character search, what they search for (if the player choose to search for a specific plant property) and a rough time investment. 

> [!important|color-yellow] Specific search
> The character might want to search for a specific plants or rarity of plants. They may do so at the cost of finding other plants but guaranteeing a success on their skill check to yield the result they desire. If the character searches for a Rare plant of a given Property, with the current season in mind, refer to either the [[World/Harvesting & Herbalism#^tableplantsraresummer\|summer]] or [[World/Harvesting & Herbalism#^tableplantsrarewinter\|winter]] tables and make sure that it grows there. A character with knowledge knows this before they begin searching. 

> [!important|color-blue] Common plants unavailability
> To add some flavor, there are no common plants growing in either of the desert biomes or the cold steppe biome.

Whether it is ==summer or winter==, as established in the [[World/Harvesting & Herbalism#Step 0 Knowledge\|knowledge]] step, refer to the table below to add a seasonal modifier to the DC to Locate plants. 

Determine what circumstances apply and inform the player. A character might have advantage or disadvantage depending on a number of things and the player should be informed about them assuming they have the knowledge. 

> [!column|no-icon] **Advantage & Disadvantage**
>> [!success|color-green] Advantage
>> - [ ] Knows the region or biome well (biologically or geographically)  
>> - [ ] Information at hand such as a book or teacher  
>> - [ ] Spending a particularly long time searching  
>> - [ ] Multiple characters involved in the search  
>> - [ ] Plants are in abundance in the area
>
>> [!failure|color-red] Disadvantage
>> - [ ] Unfamiliar environment  
>> - [ ] Spending a short amount of time  
>> - [ ] Poor perception such as darkness without aid to see or bad weather 
>> - [ ] Plants are scarce in the area or people often harvest in the area 
>> - [ ] Looking for specific plants where the vegetation is thick{ #tableplantscircumstances}


Once modifiers are set and the new DC for each tier of plant is determined, the player roll Herbalism Kit (Wisdom), Survival (Wisdom) or Nature (Wisdom) and refer to to the Locate Plants table below. 

**Critical Success** might mean that the character find rare plants regardless of the result.

**Critical Failure** might mean that the character spends more time than intended or becoming lost for a short while, without finding any plants.

## Rare Plants

When a plant of Rare rarity is located, roll a d100 (might as well let the player roll), with the season in mind, refer to either table below, to determine what plant is located. Only four types of Rare plants grow in a region during each season, with one being particularly rare during that season. The column labeled "none" determines the property of plant that does not grow in that biome during that season.

Consult the Harvest Plants table below to determine how much a player has successfully harvested.
