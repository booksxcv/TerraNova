The exchange from gold standard to silver standard have 3 purposes. ^[This homebrew is inspired by [this reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/5tt9tj/i_created_silver_standard_for_5_edition/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and utilises [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lQe3fhLuW9zJ36RWSofH03-j0Igc50hUhX6teRnwUsI/edit#gid=1355379407).] 

>[!info]- The various denominators and who uses them
> - Copper coins are used mainly the lower classes - thugs, thieves, criminals and beggars, etc. 
> - Silver coins are used mainly be the working class - craftsmen, farmers, office workers and service people, etc. 
> - Gold coins are used mainly by the upper class - aristocrats, wealthy businessmen, companies and governments. 

1. Make gold a rarity, to further increase the feeling of actual treasure as well as making any users of gold stand out amongst the masses. 
2. Solving issues of carrying thousands of coins and instead increase the worth of these fewer coins. 
3. More true to recorded history, where the silver coin was the standard as gold was far to valuable to be used in coinage.

> [!important|c-yellow] How to convert
> As the change happens, we start by converting all silver coins to copper at the previous exchange rate (x10). Following that, we simply exchange all mentions of GP (gold coins) to SP (silver coins) and convert all prices in silver to 10x in copper.
