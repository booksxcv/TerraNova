# Crafting Progress 

## Knowledge

When a character wish to craft something, the first thing that must be determined is whether they know how to do it. If they do not, they must seek out the information using schematics or instructions or invent the schematics as described in [[World/Discovery Progress\|Discovery Progress]]. A DM may rule that a character already has full, partial or no understanding of what they are trying to make, taking the proficiencies and past experiences of the character into account.

Ways to learn
- Acquire schematics - by purchasing, looting or inventing 
- Instructed - by an NPC or other player character

> [!example]- Example: Simple House
> Per Stress wants to build a house. He has proficiency in carpenter's tools so he decides to make it out of wood. It is a simple house and a straight-forward process. 
> 
> The DM determines that Per Stress knows how to make a house as he is proficient in carpenter's tools and Per Stress also grew up in a village where these houses were common.

## Sum

The sum of the project is determined by the DM and expressed in an amount of money. Likewise, the *resources invested* is expressed in an amount of money. The *resources invested / sum* represent all things related to the project. 
The crafting progress start at 0. For each day of work a player spend time working on the project, they may roll various ability checks, described in [[World/Crafting & Construction#Working on the project\|Working on the project]], to *"convert"* the money worth of raw resources needed for the project. When the *resources invested* reach the *sum*, the project is finished. 
A player may use specific materials to gain additional flavor or mechanical effects, appropriate to the requests made, approved by the DM and then fulfilled by the player during the process. A DM might decide that a particular thing requires specific materials and their worth and these should be kept separate from the base sum. The base sum assumes that the product is functional and in good condition and any changes or specifics may alter the product. 

> [!example]- Example: Simple House
> Now they need to know how much this will cost. 
> The DM and Per Stress discuss and agree that 200 silver is enough for the very simple house that Per wants to build. 
> Per Stress proceeds to purchase some 150 silver worth of wood planks along with other relevant materials that they agree to summarize as *"house construction materials"* and gather the rest, using traditional skill checks or to the DM's discretion.

## Scale

The scale of the project determines how many workers can contribute to the crafting progress at the same time.

Crafting Project Scale Table

|    Scale    | Max workers |
|:----------:|:-----------:|
|   Medium   |      2      |
|   Large    |      4      |
|    Huge    |      8      |
| Gargantuan |     16      |{ #craftingprojectscale}


> [!example]- Example: Simple House
> Now they need to determine the scale of the project. 
> The DM thinks this is a large project and Per Stress agrees, making it possible for him to have up to three other characters also working on the project. 
> Per Stress asks his companion Spon Pretts to help out on the project. The DM determines that Spon Pretts does not have proficiency in the appropriate skills. She can still help, but will contribute less to the project. 
> Per Stress also seek out two employees, one skilled and one unskilled. He has enough money to pay them for the entire duration, 2 silver and 20 copper per day respectively.

## Working on the project

For each day of work (8 hours), any characters working on the project may roll an ability check to contribute to the *resources invested*, assuming the necessary materials and resources are at hand. For medium scale projects, this check may instead be performed for every 4 hours of work. 

The checks are suggested by the players and approved by the DM. If the player can creatively suggest on how they use a particular skill to assist in the project and the DM agree, they may do so. The DM can decide that certain skills are available or unavailable at any point in the progress, and the DM might require certain checks to be involved as appropriate to the materials used. A carpenter might not be able to work with metal well enough to make a lock of metal. 

Examples
- Athletics. Help carry, move and lift resources needed. 
- Arcana or spellcasting modifier. If a character has access to relevant magic such as spells or abilities that may help in the process, they might ask for such a check if the DM agrees.
- Appropriate tool kit, with ability set by the DM. At least one such check must be performed to finish the project. 

For each check made by a player character, they may *"convert"* raw materials to *resources invested* in the project. To do so, you must have the resources necessary at hand. The amount of materials you may convert to is equal to the total rolled in the check, with a minimum of 10. If you critically hit, you may roll the same check again and contribute the new total in addition to the previous and you may only do this once. If you critically fail, there is no contribution to the *resources invested*. 

The DM may impose advantage and disadvantage as they see fit.

> [!note|c-yellow]
> There is no DC for these rolls, anyone working toward the project aids contribution once per time unit 

### NPC workers

Like player characters, NPC workers can contribute to the project. They roll a check as appropriate to their skills and have no ability modifiers. Two checks may be performed, one for all unskilled workers and one for all skilled workers. The workers contribute to the *resources invested* in the same manner as a player character and each worker adds 1 to the result, except the first one (the first worker instead allows you to perform the check). 
The skilled workers contribute to the *resources invested* in the same way as a player character but the minimum is 5 instead of 10. They also benefit from the leading player characters proficiency bonus in their roll. 
The unskilled workers contribute only half of the result and have a minimum of 5 instead of 10. If there are only unskilled workers employed, the check is made with disadvantage, unless a player character with appropriate knowledge forgo their own check to manage the unskilled workers. 

> [!example]- Example: Simple House
> Per Stress starts construction with all people present and all materials on hand, 200 silver worth of house building materials. 
> The Example table shows the progress per day.

> Example Table
>
> | Day | Per Stress                              | Spon Pretts                    | Skilled worker       | Unskilled worker                 | Resources Invested / Cost         |
> |:---:|:--------------------------------------- |:------------------------------ |:-------------------- |:-------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
> |  1  | Carpentry (Str) (+3) = 15               | Athletics (+2) = 10            | Carpentry (+PB) = 7  | Strength (+0) = 9 (halved to 4, minimum 5)  | 15 + 10 + 7 + 5 = 37 / 200        |
> |  2  | Carpentry (Str) (+3) = 18               | Athletics (+2) = Crit Fail (0) | Carpentry (+PB) = 9  | Strength (+0) = 8 (halved to 4, minimum 5)  | 37 + 32(Day 2 total) = 69 / 200   |
> |  3  | Carpentry (Str) (+3) = 11               | Athletics (+2) = 17            | Carpentry (+PB) = 12 | Strength (+0) = 15 (halved to 7) | 67 + 47(Day 3 total) = 116 / 200  |
> |  4  | Carpentry (Str) (+3) = Crit Hit (23+10) | Athletics (+2) = 13            | Carpentry (+PB) = 11 | Strength (+0) = 19 (halved to 8) | 114 + 65(Day 4 total) = 181 / 200 |
> |  5  | Carpentry (Str) (+3) = 11               | Athletics (+2) = 10            | Carpentry (+PB) = 7  | Strength (+0) = 11 (halved to 5) | 179 + 33(Day 3 total) = 214 / 200 |

It takes 5 days to complete the Example: Simple House. Since the contributed work went beyond 200 silver coins, the DM might rule that the fifth day only needed a few hours of work rather than the full 8 hours or they might refund some of the money spent on hirelings, representing that they only worked for part of the day. The player might also be given a minor addition if they have any creative input.
