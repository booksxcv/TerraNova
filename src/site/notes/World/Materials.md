# Materials

Materials are a simple and straight-forward gatekeeper to craft magic items. They also serve to introduce rewards in other formats than coins which the PC can use to craft magic items or sell for coins. They add minor flavor to the world.

# Dawnmetal

*Dawnmetal, also known as Solarium or Sunfire Gold, is a remarkable metal that emerges exclusively in the scorching and arid landscapes of hot deserts and steppes. Its appearance is a true testament to the essence of the sun itself - a reddish crystal-like form sometimes with golden specks embedded in irregular patterns emanating a radiant, pale golden hue that seems to capture the very warmth and light of day within its crystalline structure.*

**Cost.** 70 silver per lbs.
**Origin.** Dawnmetal is believed to be a divine creation, a material born from the touch of the sun's spirit upon the earth. It is found deep within the heart of sun-scorched deserts and ancient volcanic calderas, where the heat and energy of the land fuse and shape the material over centuries. The sun's spirit is said to bless those who are able to harness Solarium's power, granting them favor and guidance in times of need.
**DM Note.** Hidden within the core of Dawnmetal is a dormant connection to the sun's spiritual realm. Those attuned to objects made of the material might discover that, during a solar eclipse, they can temporarily awaken this connection. During the eclipse, Solarium can absorb and store solar energy, granting its possessor heightened abilities, increased vitality, or even the power to cast light and heat-based spells without expending their own magical energy. However, prolonged or excessive use of this ability could draw the attention of celestial beings or put heavy strain on the users body, leading to both wondrous rewards and unforeseen challenges. The material also serves as a key component in constructing true temples devoted to the sun's spirit and like all celestial metals works well when crafting and infusing magic objects. 

> [!note]- **Additional Suggestions**
> - Dawnmetal could be incorporated into the crafting of powerful sunlight-infused weapons and armor, offering unique properties against creatures vulnerable to sunlight.
> - The material might serve as a key component in constructing ancient sun temples, unlocking their secrets and granting access to hidden chambers or blessings.
> - Solarium could also be a central element in a prophecy or a celestial event, requiring adventurers to gather it to prevent an impending catastrophe or to seize a great opportunity.

# Lunsteel

*Lunsteel, derived from the words 'lunar' and 'steel', also known as Moonsteel, Moonsilver or Lunarium in some societies, is a unique and mysterious metal that manifests in three distinct variants, each intimately tied to the celestial influences of the moons. These glowing alloys are prized for their innate magical properties, and their appearances are as captivating as the moons themselves, coming in shades of white, violet, and red.*

**Cost.**
- White Lunsteel: ~70 silver per lbs.
- Violet Lunsteel: ~100 silver per lbs.
- Red Lunsteel: ~200 silver per lbs.

**Origin.** The origin of moonsilver is veiled in mystique. It is believed that moonsilver manifest at locations where precious metals such as silver and platinum exist during the night of the three moons. They can only be mined properly in the light of the corresponding colors moon and their potency to be infused with magic is tied to the phase of the moon that was present when the metal was mined and worked, an additional reason to why the red variant is the most prized as well as the most rare. 
**DM Note.** Moonsilver is highly attuned to the phases of its corresponding moon. When properly harnessed and attuned, moonsilver can augment magic cast under the moon's light, allowing for enhanced spellcasting or even the manipulation of magical effects. However, its power waxes and wanes with the moon's phases, and overusing it during the wrong phase might lead to unpredictable results or exhaust the metal's magical resonance. Moonsilver is typically used in lunar rituals and in crafting of magic objects. It also has all the properties of silver when weaponized, against creatures that have natural weakness to silver. 

> [!note]- **Additional Suggestions**
> - Moonsilver could play a pivotal role in lunar rituals, granting access to hidden realms, unlocking ancient moon-based magic, or even facilitating communication with moon-related entities.
> - Enchanted Moonsilver weapons or armor could be exceptionally effective against creatures of the night, lycanthropes, or other moon-affiliated beings.
> - Crafting a set of Moonsilver jewelry might provide adventurers with unique lunar-themed abilities, granting them advantages in certain environments or circumstances.

# Astralite

*Astralite, also recognized by the alternate names Starstone, is a captivating mineral that boasts a unique and enchanting appearance. Its silvery fog-like gray hue is met with a semi-translucent quality, revealing glimpses of twinkling lights trapped within its depths in unpredictable constellations. Unlike metals, this mineral bears stone-like traits, requiring it to be skillfully carved rather than forged - particularly when crafting substantial structures and creations from it.*

**Cost.** 80+ silver per lbs. price varies depending on the size and amount of lights in the starstone in question.
**Origin.** Starstone is said to be fragments of individual stars spirits whose star has been extinguished. In modern lore, it materializes spontaneously and randomly but it has been recorded to happen more frequently during particularly clear nights when some constellations are in prominent display on the night sky. Oftentimes, starstone appear on ground level but the ore can reach several meters down into the ground, which makes them a treasure to be found by wealth seekers across the world. Typically, they are found at locations distinguished from its neighbouring areas and on peaks that seek the sky. Starstone is particularly hard to mine for the reason that when the twinkling lights trapped inside meet open air, they fade out and the stone may completely lose or diminish in value, as the potency of the stone is related to the amount of lights in the piece. 
**DM Note.** Starstone is imbued with a latent astral energy, which grants those who possess it the ability to channel and manipulate the subtle forces of the cosmos. When properly attuned, it can augment divination and scrying spells, enhancing the caster's ability to perceive distant places and uncover hidden truths. It is also believed that crafting a focus or amulet from starstone can grant its bearer limited astral projection, allowing them to temporarily venture beyond their physical form and explore the ethereal plane. 

Starstone, with its typical places of discovery, have become a central part to the lore and stories of the sentient races that dwell on the peaks of the world.

> [!note]- **Additional Suggestions**
> - Starstone could be used to create powerful and intricately designed telescopes, enhancing the user's ability to observe celestial phenomena and even granting unique insights into the future.
> - Carvings and sculptures made from Starstone might possess the ability to capture and display ethereal scenes or visions, making them prized by fortune-tellers and seers.
> - The mineral could play a role in unlocking ancient star maps or navigating through magical pathways across the planes, creating intriguing quests for adventurers.

# Seerwood

*Seerwood, also known as Realmwood or Karadoran Heartwood, is a unique type of wood that possesses an enigmatic origin shrouded in mystery. Despite its disputed roots, this wood has made appearances in distant and seemingly unrelated locations, capturing the fascination of those fortunate enough to encounter it. The true source of its growth remains a puzzle, although the Karadorian people have found a deep connection with this material.*

**Cost.** Prices for Seerwood vary considerably, often influenced by the shape and craftsmanship of the wood. On average, it can range from 80 to 130 silver per lbs.
**Origin.** The true origin of Seerwood remains a subject of speculation among scholars and adventurers alike. However, stories persist that these rare trees, with their striking dark hues embezzled with bronze-veined or light brown with dark purple to black-veined patterns, are said to emerge from the interplay between the material and other realms. It is rumored that full-sized trees of Seerwood grow on the Isle of Karanda, but since few people visit their island, it has never been confirmed. The Karandan people, who consider Seerwood sacred, protect their secret that the trees flourish in a few places, secretive and well-guarded, where the wood and its location holds profound spiritual significance.
**DM Note.** Seerwood possesses a unique duality that mirrors its ethereal nature. When crafted into items, it retains a fraction of its connection to the ethereal plane. Those attuned to Seerwood equipment might occasionally experience ephemeral glimpses into otherworldly realms, granting them insights or knowledge that could be of significant value. Moreover, weapons or tools made from this wood might be able to partially phase through solid matter, bypassing some defenses or resistance. 

> [!note]- **Additional Suggestions**
> - Seerwood could be the focus of quests or missions, as adventurers seek to uncover the truth behind its origin, leading them to hidden Karandan enclaves or ancient sacred sites.
> - Weapons made from Seerwood might be particularly effective against creatures with connections to the ethereal plane, ghosts, or otherworldly entities.
> - The wood's rarity and spiritual importance could make it a potent ingredient in rituals or spells, potentially enhancing their effects or allowing casters to interact with spirits more easily.

# Wildmyst

*Wildmyst, alternatively referred to as Animystic Essence, is actually an afflicition, not a material. It describes a unique and unexplainable phenomenon that occurs spontaneously within the animal kingdom. This extraordinary occurrence imbues the fur, skin, bones, and other organic components of creatures with latent magical properties, rendering the materials harvested from these animals exceptionally attuned to arcane energies.*

**No Fixed Cost.** Due to the vast array of creatures and sizes that can experience the Wildmyst phenomenon, the price of these enchanted materials varies widely. Crafters and traders often assess each piece individually, considering factors such as size, rarity, and the specific magical properties infused into the material.
**Origin.** The origins of Wildmyst remain a puzzle, confounding scholars and enchanters alike. Some theorize that the phenomenon is an unpredictable interaction between the natural world and of magic itself, while others suggest it might be the result of celestial alignments or as a rest product of overlapping realms. This occurrence is more prevalent in the northern regions of Aramen, but its unpredictable nature prevents any precise pattern from emerging. Wildmyst materials are known to exist in many types, but new ways to utilize are discovered every now and then by learned scholars of Aramen. It comes in types such as leather, fur, fabric and thread woven from the furs of creatures, scales, bones and feathers, but are not limited to those.
**DM Note.** Creatures affected by Wildmyst undergo unique physical changes, often manifesting as vibrant patterns, glowing marks, or even subtle bioluminescence in their fur, skin, scales, or feathers. Adventurers who encounter such creatures might find themselves drawn into quests or conflicts involving these magical beings, their inherent properties a source of fascination and potential danger. In the [[Aramen/Nations of Aramen/Centaur Wilds\|Centaur Wilds]], a centaur king is affected by this condition, a secret they do not share with outsiders. 

> [!note]- **Additional Suggestions**
> - Wildmyst could lead to the creation of sought-after enchanted items, including cloaks, armor, and even tapestries woven from the wildmyst fur or thread.
> - Collecting materials from Wildmyst-imbued creatures might require specialized knowledge or tools, as the magical energy can react unexpectedly during harvesting.
> - The uniqueness of Wildmyst-imbued creatures could make them targets for poachers, magic researchers, or even rival factions seeking to harness their innate properties.
