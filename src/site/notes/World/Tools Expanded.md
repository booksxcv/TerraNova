# Camera

A [[Objects/Camera\|camera]] functions much like a tool kit but have a specific ruleset as described. 

# Clockwork Tools

## Components
The first paragraph in each description gives details on what a set of supplies or tools is made up of. A character who is proficient with a tool knows how to use all of its component parts.

## Skills
Every tool potentially provides advantage on a check when used in conjunction with certain skills, provided a character is proficient with the tool and the skill. As DM, you can allow a character to make a check using the indicated skill with advantage. Paragraphs that begin with skill names discuss these possibilities. In each of these paragraphs, the benefits apply only to someone who has proficiency with the tool, not someone who simply owns it.

With respect to skills, the system is mildly abstract in terms of what a tool proficiency represents; essentially, it assumes that a character who has proficiency with a tool also has learned about facets of the trade or profession that are not necessarily associated with the use of the tool.

In addition, you can consider giving a character extra information or an added benefit on a skill check. The text provides some examples and ideas when this opportunity is relevant.

## Special Use
Proficiency with a tool usually brings with it a particular benefit in the form of a special use, as described in this paragraph.

## Sample DCs
A table at the end of each section lists activities that a tool can be used to perform, and suggested DCs for the necessary ability checks.
