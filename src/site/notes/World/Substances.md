# Substances

Substances are product of herbalism which are separate from the traditional potions for two reasons; they are non-magical. Although they can mimic spells and other magical effects, they do not count as spells or magical for spells like [[z_references/Spells/Detect Magic\|Detect Magic]] and similar, unless specifically described.

## Types

**Brew.** A liquid substance can be mixed with another drink or drunk alone to grant its effects. Many have taste or smell which may be noticeable. Assuming proficiency in the correct tools, crafting brews is easy and does not require rolls.

**Natural.** A natural substance is something that retains it's natural shape and/or state. Flowers, leafs, seeds and buds often fall into this category. They can be consumed or inhaled by burning them and inhaling the smoke. It's often easy to conserve plants in this way and does not require a roll, unless the DM decides that a particularly hard thing to craft.

**Oil.** An oil can be consumed plainly, can be mixed with consumed or burned (thus inhaled) using incense sticks. Oil is easy to craft and do not require any rolls.

**Powder.** A powder substance is the most versatile of the substances, can be mixed with drink or food, inhaled or consumed in other ways, like injected directly into the blood stream. Some have taste which may be noticeable.

**Salve.** A salve is a milder way of applying various substances, particularly hard to do to an unwilling target. They are rubbed on skin to grant effect. Generally quite easy to craft.

**Tincture.** A tincture is a concentrated brew, that only requires a small number of drops to be effective. It is more difficult to craft. It is often potent enough in small volume to not leave traces of taste or smell. A tincture is hard to craft, to succeed in such a task you must succeed on a skill check using Herbalism Kit (Intelligence). The DC for Uncommon Tinctures is 10 and increases by 5 for each higher rarity.
