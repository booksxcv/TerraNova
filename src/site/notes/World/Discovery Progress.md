# Discovery Progress summary

This system is a simplification of the time it takes to understand or invent something. This system deals only with the theory and to pursue practical invention, see the [[World/Crafting & Construction\|Crafting & Construction]]. 

There are four simple parts to this inventing system. 
1. [[World/Discovery Progress#Current progress\|Current Progress]]
3. [[World/Discovery Progress#Advancement Rate\|Advancement Rate]]
4. [[World/Discovery Progress#Time Period\|Time Period]]
5. [[World/Discovery Progress#Difficulty DC\|Difficulty DC]]

> [!important] In summary; the systems follows the formula: 
> The starting point in *Current Progress* is determined. For each *Time Period* spent pursuing a project, a roll may be made using the appropriate skill for the project against the *Difficulty DC*. If successful, you roll the die that is your *Advancement Rate* and add that to the *Current Progress* and when it reached 100, the character has fully understood what they have been studying or invented the new thing.

## Current progress

The Current Progress of any project is measured in a percentage, ranging from 0-100. At 100%, the studied or invented thing is fully understood or the theory behind it created. When a project is started, the DM determines any prerequisite knowledge that may be necessary or that a character might already have. A project does not need to start at 0 if the character already has some understanding of it's elements. 

## Advancement Rate

The Advancement Rate is how quickly additional progress is added to a project. It is represented by an amount of dice of a given size, where the fewer face dice represent slower learning. Once for each time period a character devotes to their project, they roll a skill (Intelligence) appropriate to the type of project. The skill can be changed, to the DM's discretion. The DC for this check is represented with a [[World/Discovery Progress#Difficulty DC\|Difficulty DC]] and can be changed as the project advances, to represent increased or decreased difficulty of continued progress. If the skill check is successful the [[World/Discovery Progress#Advancement Rate\|Advancement Rate]] die is rolled and the value added to the [[World/Discovery Progress#Current progress\|Current Progress]]. 

## Time Period

The Time Period states the amount of consecutive time that is required to spend time to advance the project. This can be simple such as 30 minutes or difficult such as 8 hours of work. You must devote time enough to the Time Period in full to be given the chance to roll against the [[World/Discovery Progress#Difficulty DC\|Difficulty DC]].

## Difficulty DC

The Difficulty DC is an arbitrary value set by the DM to determine how difficult it is to grasp the concepts that are part of the theoretical knowledge necessary to understand something enough to construct, modify or invent. The Difficulty DC may be changed at the DM's discretion.
