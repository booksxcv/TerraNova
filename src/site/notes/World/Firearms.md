\* *The Hand Mortar is a new type of weapon that is has not properly reached markets yet, as such it must be crafted to be obtained. Regarding its special property - A shell shot from a Hand Mortar targets a location and arcs to reach it's target. As such, you require some open space above to successfully hit a target location. This is reflected in the AC that you must beat to successfully hit your target location. As they are powerful weapons, there is always a drawback for not hitting your target. The DM might decide that the shell fired hit some other place, potentially hurting you or your allies.* 

### Firearm Properties
Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their own unique set of weapon properties. Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of that property (outlined below). These properties replace the optional ones presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Firearms are ranged [[z_references/Weapons\|Weapons]] and deal piercing damage unless specified in the ammunition used.

### Reload
The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.

### Misfire
Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. 

### Repair
Whenever a firearm misfires, you must spend an action to repair it. You must succeed in a Gunsmith's Kit check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score) using your dexterity (if you have crafted the firearm yourself you may instead use your intelligence). For every time you fail this check and you try to repair your firearm again, the DC increases by 2. Alternatively, when you are not in combat, you can spend time to fully repair your firearm using Gunsmith spare parts to automatically succeed on this check. The silver worth of spare part that must be spent to repair a firearm in this way is equal to (10 + the misfire score) x the number of times the DC has been increased. It takes one minute x the number of times the DC has been increased to repair the firearm. You must have both hands free to repair a firearm. #review 

### Explosive 
Upon a hit, everything within the range listed in the type of explosive of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer the damage listed in the type of explosive. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.

### Ammunition
All firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their uncommon rarity, ammunition may be difficult to find. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your [[World/Tools Expanded#Gunsmith's Kit\|Gunsmith's Kit]] at half the cost. Each firearm uses its own unique ammunition and is sold or crafted in batches listed in the table. When you craft ammunition, you must spend 1 hour of time and succeed on a check using your tools against the DC listed for the type of ammunition you are crafting. The amount of material you must spend to craft a batch of ammunition for a given type of firearm is half the cost to buy a batch of the same ammunition. To craft any of the special ammunitions, the materials you must spend is a value derived from the full cost of the basic ammunition for that type of firearm. For all basic ammunition, the DC to craft is 10 + that type of firearm's misfire score. If the check fails, your materials are spent and you still craft basic ammunition but only half the batch, rounded up.

### Crafting
To craft a firearm yourself, you must have knowledge of how to craft it. There are a few ways to do this. The most straight-forward way is to have access to schematics and then performing an Investigation check against the craft DC to understand it. You may also learn the schematics by having someone else teach them to you, and in the same manner you must perform an Investigation check to understand it. 
You may also invent the schematic yourself by dedicating time to design it. The details on how to add and track progress is written in [[World/Discovery Progress\|Discovery Progress]].
